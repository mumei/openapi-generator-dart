## ‚ö†Ô∏è System Requirements

### Java Requirement
> **Java is required to use this library.**  
> The OpenAPI Generator CLI is a Java application.  
> Please ensure you have Java (version 8 or higher) installed and available in your system PATH.  
> You can check your Java installation with:
>
> ```sh
> java -version
> ```
>
> If you do not have Java installed, download it from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Flutter/Dart Compatibility
This package supports:
- **Flutter**: 3.32.0 and later
- **Dart SDK**: 3.8.0 and later 
- **analyzer**: ^7.4.0
- **source_gen**: ^3.0.0
- **build_runner**: Compatible with the latest versions

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation & Breaking Change Notice

### `skipIfSpecIsUnchanged` is Deprecated

- The `skipIfSpecIsUnchanged` option is now **deprecated** and will be removed in the next major release.
- **Local OpenAPI specs** are now automatically watched for changes.  
  - If your spec file is in the `lib/` folder, this works out of the box.
  - If your spec file is outside `lib/`, you must update or add a `build.yaml` to include your spec file as a source.  
    Example:
    ```yaml
    targets:
      $default:
        sources:
          - $package$
          - lib/**
          - openapi.yaml # or your spec file path
    ```
- **Remote specs:**  
  Use the `forceAlwaysRun` (defaults to false) option to ensure the generator always runs.  
  - This option is ignored for local specs.
  - When enabled, it modifies the annotated file to force regeneration. This might cause issues such as merge conflicts

## Overview

This repository provides Dart/Flutter libraries for generating OpenAPI client SDKs directly from your OpenAPI specification. Inspired by [Openapi Generator Cli (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli), it enables seamless integration into Dart and Flutter projects.

### üöÄ Flutter 3.32.0 Compatible

This package has been updated to fully support **Flutter 3.32.0** and the latest Dart SDK with:
- Updated `analyzer` package to ^7.4.0 for enhanced static analysis
- Updated `source_gen` to ^3.0.0 for improved code generation
- Full compatibility with the latest Element2 API changes
- Enhanced build performance and reliability

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Dependencies

Add the annotations package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  openapi_generator_annotations: ^<latest-version>
```

Add the generator as a dev dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  openapi_generator: ^<latest-version>
```

> **Beta Features:**  
> For beta features, use the `beta` branch:
>
> ```yaml
> dependencies:
>   openapi_generator_annotations:
>     git:
>       url: https://github.com/gibahjoe/openapi-generator-dart.git
>       ref: beta
>       path: openapi-generator-annotations
>
> dev_dependencies:
>   openapi_generator:
>     git:
>       url: https://github.com/gibahjoe/openapi-generator-dart.git
>       ref: beta
>       path: openapi-generator
> ```

### 2. Annotate Your Dart Class

Annotate a Dart class with `@Openapi()` to configure code generation:

```dart
import 'package:openapi_generator_annotations/openapi_generator_annotations.dart';

@Openapi(
  additionalProperties: DioProperties(pubName: 'petstore_api', pubAuthor: 'Johnny Depp'),
  inputSpec: RemoteSpec(path: 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json'),
  typeMappings: {'Pet': 'ExamplePet'},
  generatorName: Generator.dio,
  runSourceGenOnOutput: true,
  outputDirectory: 'api/petstore_api',
)
class Example {}
```

### 3. Generate the SDK

Run the build command:

```sh
# For Dart projects
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# For Flutter projects (recommended)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

> **Note for Flutter 3.32.0 users:** If you encounter any build issues, ensure you have the latest compatible versions of `build_runner` and related packages installed.

The generated SDK will appear in the specified output directory.

## Next Generation Features (v5.0+)

- **Spec Caching:** Automatically caches your OpenAPI spec for faster incremental builds.
- **Remote Spec Support:** Pulls and caches remote specs; always fetches the latest version unless using a local copy.
- **Smart Generation:** Skips code generation if there are no changes in the spec or based on flags.
- **All previous features remain available.**

**Example:**

```dart
@Openapi(
  additionalProperties: DioProperties(pubName: 'petstore_api', pubAuthor: 'Johnny Depp'),
  inputSpec: RemoteSpec(path: 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json'),
  typeMappings: {'Pet': 'ExamplePet'},
  generatorName: Generator.dio,
  runSourceGenOnOutput: true,
  outputDirectory: 'api/petstore_api',
)
class Example {}
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

If you are having issues with the generated code, this is not an problem with this package and creating an issue here will not help solve it. Its best to [create the issue in the base OpenApi library](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues) since this package is a wrapper around that library for ease of use with Flutter/dart.

Below are some advanced configurations you may try.

- **Custom Templates:**  
  Use the `templateDirectory` parameter to specify a custom code generation template.

- **Type & Import Mappings:**  
  Use `typeMappings` and `importMappings` to control how OpenAPI types and models are mapped in Dart.

- **Reserved Words:**  
  Use `reservedWordsMappings` to avoid conflicts with Dart reserved words.

**Example:**

```dart
@Openapi(
  additionalProperties: DioProperties(pubName: 'custom_api', pubAuthor: 'Jane Doe'),
  inputSpec: InputSpec(path: 'openapi-spec.yaml'),
  generatorName: Generator.dio,
  templateDirectory: 'templates/dart',
  typeMappings: {'date': 'DateTime'},
  importMappings: {'DateTime': 'package:my_project/date_time.dart'},
  reservedWordsMappings: {'class': 'clazz'},
  outputDirectory: 'api/custom_api',
)
class CustomApi {}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Flutter 3.32.0 Compatibility:**  
  If you encounter build issues after upgrading to Flutter 3.32.0:
  ```bash
  # Clear pub cache
  dart pub cache clean
  # Reinstall dependencies
  flutter pub get
  # Clear build cache
  dart run build_runner clean
  # Run build
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

- **Analyzer/Source Gen Compatibility Issues:**  
  Ensure you're using compatible versions:
  ```yaml
  dev_dependencies:
    build_runner: ^2.6.0  # or latest
    openapi_generator: ^7.0.0  # latest with Flutter 3.32.0 support
  ```

- **Riverpod Generator Compatibility:**  
  If you encounter conflicts with `riverpod_generator`, this has been resolved in v7.0.0+ with relaxed build constraints:
  ```yaml
  dev_dependencies:
    openapi_generator: ^7.0.0  # Compatible with riverpod_generator
    riverpod_generator: ^2.6.1  # or any version
  ```

- **Dependency Conflicts:**  
  Use `dependency_overrides` in the generated package's `pubspec.yaml` and add `pubspec.yaml` to `.openapi-generator-ignore` to prevent overwrites.

- **Incorrect Generated Code:**  
  - Fix your OpenAPI spec (preferred).
  - Manually edit the generated code and add the files to `.openapi-generator-ignore` to prevent them from being overwritten.

**.openapi-generator-ignore Example:**

```gitignore
# Ignore all test files
test/*
# Ignore pubspec.yaml to preserve manual changes
pubspec.yaml
```
